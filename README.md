# Statistical-Arbitrage-and-Pairs-Trading-with-Machine-Learning

## Overview

This project implements a machine learning-driven statistical arbitrage strategy for pairs trading. By leveraging cointegration and correlation analysis, it identifies tradable asset pairs and predicts spread movements using machine learning models. A backtesting framework evaluates strategy performance, ensuring robust risk management and profitability.

## Key Features

Pairs Selection: Identifies asset pairs using statistical methods like cointegration and correlation analysis.
Machine Learning Models: Utilizes predictive models to forecast spread movements and optimize trade execution.
Backtesting Framework: Simulates historical performance to evaluate profitability and risk exposure.
Risk Management: Implements stop-loss and position-sizing strategies for controlled trading.
